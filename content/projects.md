Over the years I built a variety of software projects. You can find them at:

* [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~fgaz)
* [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/fgaz)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/fgaz)
* [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/user/fgaz) (Haskell packages)
* [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/users/fgaz/) (Minetest mods)

Many of the FOSS projects I contributed to are indexed at [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/fgaz).

There used to be a list of notable projects here, but it quickly got out of date -- refer to the links above.
